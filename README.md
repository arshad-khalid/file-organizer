**📂 Automatic File Organizer**

A Python application built with Tkinter to help organize files from a source directory to a destination directory. This tool categorizes files based on type, creation date, and file size, with options for moving or copying files and automatic compression of large files.

✨ **Features**

	•	🗂️ Automatic Organization: Sorts files into folders by file type (Images, Videos, Documents, Others) and by month of creation.
	•	🔀 Move or Copy: Choose between moving files (removing from source) or copying files (keeping source intact).
	•	🚫 Duplicate Detection: Uses MD5 hashing to skip duplicate files in the destination.
	•	📦 Compression for Large Files: Automatically compresses files larger than 10 MB.
	•	📈 Progress Tracking: Displays progress and status updates as files are organized.

**🚀 Getting Started

✅ Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. This application only uses standard libraries:

	•	os
	•	shutil
	•	datetime
	•	hashlib
	•	zipfile
	•	mimetypes
	•	threading
	•	tkinter

No external dependencies are required.

📥 **Installation**

1.	Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/arshad-khalid/file-organizer.git```


2.	Navigate to the project directory:

```cd file-organizer```


3.	Run the application:

```python file-organizer.py```



💻 **Usage**

	1.	Launch the application.
	2.	Use the Browse buttons to select a source folder (containing files to organize) and a destination folder (where organized files will be stored).
	3.	Check or uncheck the “Move files instead of copying” option to choose your preferred file handling method.
	4.	Click Organize Files to start the organization process.

The application will categorize files by type and creation date, remove duplicates, and compress any files over 10 MB.

**🗂️ File Organization Structure**

Files in the destination directory will be organized as follows:
```
Destination_Folder/
├── Documents/
│   ├── 2023-01/
│   │   └── example.pdf
│   └── 2023-02/
│       └── example.docx
├── Images/
│   └── 2023-01/
│       └── example.jpg
├── Videos/
│   └── 2023-03/
│       └── example.mp4
└── Others/
    └── 2023-01/
        └── example.txt
```
⚠️ **Notes**

	•	Duplicate files with matching MD5 hashes in the destination will be skipped.
	•	Files larger than 10 MB will be compressed into .zip archives to save space.
